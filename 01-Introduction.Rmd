# Introduction
Welcome to *bono usu*, a book about good practice for R programming. This book
tries to compile and extend resources on the topic of good practice in R
programming in a rather borad sense. Since in many regards, there is no best
practice, the aim of the book is to impart at least good practice.

The book covers the following topics:

* Code style guide: This chapter is about low level style use in R. 
* Workflow & collaboration: In this chapter, we introduce some commonly used
workflow tools and how one can make the most of them as well as more high-level
practices in project organizations.
* Package development: Finally, we address the topic of developing extensions 
for R.
