# Introduction
Welcome to *bono usu*, a book about good practice for R programming. This book
tries to compile and further build upon resources on the topic of good practice 
in R programming in a somewhat broad sense. Mainly, Hadley Wickham's [style 
section](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) in Advanced R and 
[Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)
served as points of reference for this book. 
We acknowledge that there is no 
clear 'best practice' when it comes to many aspects of R code style, workflow 
etc, but there are certainly some principles which can direct one towards 
'better practice'.  
\
When collaborating with others on code projects it is hugely beneficial (if not 
essential) to agree on and abide by some style guidelines and workflow in order 
to facilitate the process of collaboration. The aim of this book is to bring 
together some popular opinion, convention, and/or suggested practice which has
helped to inform us in facilitating our own consensus on 'good practice'.  
\
The book covers the following topics:

* Code style guide: This chapter is about low level style use in R. 
* Workflow & collaboration: In this chapter, we introduce some commonly used 
  workflow tools, and explore how one can make the most of them, while taking a 
  broader perspective on high-level practices in the organisation of projects.
* Package development: Finally, we address the topic of developing extensions 
  for R. 

\
The target audience of the book are R users that have reached an intermediate 
level. However, we try to include reference material to some fundamental concepts 
that one needs to be familiar with in order to follow the author's reasoning.
